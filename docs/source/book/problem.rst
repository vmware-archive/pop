POP, What it Seeks to Solve
===========================

Plugin Oriented Programming seeks to bring together concepts and wisdom from the
history of computing in new ways to solve modern computing problems. To introduce
Plugin Oriented Programming, it is necessary to first cover the problems
in computing today, and where they came from. It is also important to answer the
question of "why". Why is introducing a new programming paradigm today the
answer to these problems?

Software development operates on a much larger scale today than ever in the history
of the practice. In fact, software development operates on a scale much larger
that any engineering practice in the history of the world. Our economy, applications,
devices and more, run on top of innumerable years of engineering effort.

The magnitude of what has been created makes the great wonders of the world that
have come before seem small in size. The pyramid of Giza, the international road network,
the power grid, and many more feats, pale in comparison to the vast collection of
software engineering that has been and continues to be created day by day.

The result is countless tracks of software, applications beyond human reckoning.

The vast array of software available today creates new problems and challenges that
cannot be addressed with existing engineering techniques. The nature of software
engineering has shifted dramatically over the last 50 years, transferring from
large corporate endeavors, to small companies and teams, to globally distributed
software engineering.

A Brief History
===============

Software engineering started in a theoretical space as the first computers were
developed with the primary purpose of executing math, breaking and creating codes
and encryption. As time moved on databases became a critical component of
computing, storing and crunching datasets became the territory of large
organizations.

This time period saw computers move from rooms of vacuum tubes into mainframes.
Applications were all driven on command line interfaces and written in procedural
and functional code. Languages that were close to the system and designed for math
dominated software engineering. Some of the largest and most complex endeavors were
Operating Systems and Databases.

Multics, and Unix
-----------------

In the 1960s the goal of creating an Operating System became the dream of
many organizations, MIT, GE and Bell Labs collaborated to create an OS called
Multics. Many of the ideas around Operating systems were developed, but in the
end Multics did not take root.

In 1969 a new Operating System was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
This system was called Unix and was inspired in large part by Multics. The Unix
Operating System lives on today in newer incarnations, primarily in Linux, but
the Unix OS concepts are also at the core of almost all major modern Operating systems,
such as MacOS.

The Unix Philosophy
-------------------

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie knew that Multics had tried to be too complicated
and created a system that was too difficult to maintain, so they created a simple
philosophy of software development for applications on Unix.

I will use Peter H. Salus' version of the Unix Philosophy to explain it here:

Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

This philosophy created the ecosystem of software that is the foundation for
most of the world's software today, but as we will see, it was not followed
into the 1990s, and computing hit consumers, and the world changed.

Windows and the GUI
-------------------

In the early 1990s we saw the emergence of a new kind of computer, a 
*Personal Computer*. A computer that fit on a desk and was meant to solve
the problems of an individual, rather than the problems of banks, governments,
and corporations.

The personal computer changed how applications were made, now the Graphical User
Interface, or GUI, became king. The GUI mandated that a new type of application needed
to be developed, one that is more familiar to modern computer users.

GUIS and Windows diverged from the Unix philosophy and introduced more than traditional
text streams. Data became more complex, as did applications.

In this era a programming paradigm became dominant, one that worked very well at
creating GUIs, Object Oriented Programming, also called OOP. The ideas around OOP had
existed for many years, but the GUI gave them new life! It became much easier to build
graphical applications when the aspects of the applications could be represented as
*objects*.

Many traditional software developers railed against OOP, saying that it would create
dirty and difficult to manage code. But OOP brought many merits to Graphical applications
and OOP made it easier to reuse other developers' code in new ways.

Rather than transferring data between programs on a command line shell using text streams,
GUIs needed to be able to manage much more complicated datasets. This gave rise to new
ways to store data outside of databases. The days of XML began, and transferring large,
structured datasets between applications began.

Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------

Object Oriented Programming quickly became the dominant form of software development
in the 1990s. With the rise of Windows and the GUI this only made sense.

OOP created a new set of rules and ideas around software development. What was once
simply creating small compact functions that are called in sequence to execute
data management and mathematical tasks, OOP changed the landscape. Introducing many
new development models and concepts, such an inheritance and polymorphism. Code became
all about making objects that represented standalone entities.

But what is the origin of OOP? Where did these ideas come from? OOP is deeply rooted
in how programming languages are written, and the core ideas are very simple. OOP is
all about bringing data together with functionality. An object expresses one of the
core concepts inside of programming languages, exposing a *type*. A *type* is used
to represent something, like a string of text or a number. But with OOP the developer
can make their own types, constructing an application from a vast collection of
types.

OOP has since become the dominant way to write software, but the world has changed once
again.

The Rise of the Web, SaaS, and Open Source
------------------------------------------

The days of personal computing have evolved into the current world, but software development
remains in large part a combination of the concepts of the past.

Since the 90's, the internet has become the dominant stage for software development.
The worlds of back end computation and graphical environments have merged together. The
code that used to be relatively thin in desktop applications, the back end code, has become
vast, on a scale that was once unimaginable, with millions of servers running massive
volumes of code. The GUIS have changes as well, with the new canvas being a web browser
and phone apps.

This entire structure is also run, in huge part, by Open Source Code. Code that is freely
given away, and whose development has enabled the modern cell phone market and the modern
data center.

This new combination has also given rise to a new way of software development. When code
is developed in the open, it no longer needs to be developed in an office. It is
developed with the world as its canvas.

The World of Today
==================

The world of today presents many unique challenges. Gone are the days of the desktop
applications dominance, the back ends of the web run almost entirely on the modern incarnation
of Unix, called Linux. The current world only exists because of Open Source and free
software, with a giant collection of free software to work with it becomes viable to
express new concepts and ideas in code in cost effective ways.

Rather than seeing a revolution in software from new concepts like we saw in the 90s,
the world of today is a combination of almost all of the innovations that the world has
seen over the last 50 years.

But the shoulders of past giants that we all stand on today presents us with new problems.

The Problems of Today
=====================

Much of the history of computing was skipped in this brief review, but it aims to set up
the issues we face today. There are a few of many areas that are worth addressing.

OOP was not made for Today's Problems
-------------------------------------

OOP was created from the bottom up. It has many brilliant concepts, but it was created
to solve issues with writing programming languages and came of age with Java, C++ and
the rise of the desktop computer and desktop GUI.

The objections of older Unix era developers (whose code we still use) ring more true today
than ever before. Most code is overly complex and brittle. Monolithic and large software
discards the wisdom of the Unix Philosophy, rather than seeking to extend it.

Today's problems are a combination of back end issues, distributed computing, distributed
development, and a new class of GUI that is not driven by the old rules of the personal
computer.

Open Source Scalability
-----------------------

Open Source creates new and unique challenges. We all rely on software that is not being
supported monetarily. The economics of Open Source have not panned out in ways that allow
it to be developed with the original goals in mind. Open Source has also diverged from
the Unix Philosophy. Early on it was all about making small applications, programs that
can be maintained by just a few engineers in their spare time. But recently Open Source
software has been driven by corporate interest and venture capital, creating large,
monolithic application stacks.

Finally, there is the problem of the Open Source developer. Many of the best and most
capable developers in the world today have written Open Source platforms that power
the world, but they have only so often become slaves to their creations. More often
than not, they are not proportionally rewarded for the work they have done and they become
bogged down in maintaining communities of contributors rather than creating more
software.

The Pull Request
----------------

Senior software developers quickly become enveloped in code review, rather than code
creation. The best developers jobs turn from brilliance to gatekeepers. Linus Torvalds
said that he no longer writes code, rather his job is to say "no". He is one of the most
brilliant developers in world, but his success has taken him from his profession.

Modern code contributions have become so easy, that they flood core developers and
mandate that they review others' code rather than work on it themselves. This drives
project leaders away from their creations and robs the world of their gifts and
robs them of the joy they once found in the act of creation.

Testing Slows Down Development
------------------------------

Code needs to be tested and verified. This become seven more critical in distributed
development teams and Open Source projects, as the reliability of the contributors
code and willingness to maintain that code falls under question.

Testing becomes more and more onerous as codebases become rapidly larger. Code bases
also need to expose complex interfaces that are often deeply difficult to test
quickly and efficiently.

Complex Code Deployment
-----------------------

Most of the modern code available today is complex to deploy and manage. Many
applications needing to work in concert in a brittle infrastructure creates
issues with infrastructure management. These issues are so bad that we have
spent the years between 2010 and 2020 reinventing how code should be deployed
time and time again, on;y introducing more and more complicated code management
models.

The Mythical Man Month
----------------------

Back in 1975 Fred Brooks published a pivotal book called *The Mythical Man Month*. This
book backed up the Unix Philosophy by stating that just hiring more engineers did not
yield proportional returns.

As codebases get larger and more monolithic, more engineers are needed to maintain them.
But those codebases get harder and harder to improve! The large teams produces less and
less new product and stagnation rules. The best engineers get bogged down in holding
up monoliths, rather than building new code.

Plugin Oriented Programming
===========================

Plugin Oriented Programming seeks to solve all of these issues by learning from the
past and applying that wisdom to the issues of today.

We start by taking the Unix Philosophy, and modernizing it:

Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

Becomes...

Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to expose interfaces that can be easily merged together.

It hardly changes, only the definition of interfaces need to be updated
to deal with data more complex that what is found in a text stream.

Lets evaluate these concepts one by one from a POP perspective.

Write programs that do one thing and do it well
-----------------------------------------------

POP is built to allow developers to write units of code in smaller, manageable
applications. But those units still function as fully capable applications.

This overcomes the *Mythical Man Month* by making sure that code is always
broken up into small units that can be managed by small developer teams.
This also makes handing off code to new developers much easier. Learning
a new codebase is exponential relative tot he size of the codebase. Something
that is only 5-20 thousand lines of code can be handed off in days, but it can take
years to transfer code that is closer to a hundred thousand lines or more.

This also makes rewrites viable. It is a regular thing to see a codebase reach its
limits, or to realize that old assumptions no longer make sense. When the code
is broken up into smaller chunks, those chunks can be more easily replaced
or refactored.

Finally, plugin based development allows for code to be externally extended. This
means that a small application can be extended easily through external plugins.
This solves the Pull Request problem. External developers can write code that
runs in the context of another app, but can be maintained and tested separately.

This allows codebases to be developed in such a way that small teams can operate
in an isolated way while extending another team's code.

Write Programs The Work Together
--------------------------------

POP builds applications that can be universally merged together. This means that
multiple applications can be merged together into one larger application. We write
monolithic code for good reasons, it is easier to deploy, and some problems
are large problems to solve. POP allows for monolithic code to be developed
in pluggable ways and them merged into the monolith for easy use and deployment.

This means that the purpose of POP applications is so that they can work
together through POP's concept of app merging.

Write programs to expose interfaces that can be easily merged together.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

POP allows applications to be written in such a way that they can run
alone or as a part of a larger application. This is done by building
apps to that they expose simple interfaces. Sometimes these interfaces
are simple function calls, of they are data queues that receive or output
data.

These simple interfaces allow for app merging and the creation of
larger applications that are themselves just small bridges between collections
of small applications.

Finally, POP applications can all be deployed as single binary deployments.
This solves the complex deployment problem, always making code easy to
distribute.

How Does POP Do This?
=====================

This book is designed to introduce you to this new and growing way of thinking
and developing. POP introduces new concepts like hierarchical namespaces,
app merging, configuration unification, dynamic code discovery and more to
build a paradigm and an ecosystem that drives towards a future of more efficient
and rapid development.

Plugin Oriented Programming.
